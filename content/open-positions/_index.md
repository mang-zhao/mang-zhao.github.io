        I am actively hiring self-motivated Bachelor, Master, and PhD Students, as well as Postdocs.

        **A Note for Chinese Students**: Although cryptography is classified as an engineering discipline in China, it is widely considered a natural science internationally and therefore requires a strong mathematical background or scientific thinking. If you're only looking to complete an undergraduate thesis as quickly as possible, this won't be an issue. However, if you aim to delve deeply into cryptography, please be mentally prepared before contacting me.

        **温馨提示:** 尽管密码学在中国被归类为工科，但在国际上它通常被视为一门自然科学，因此需要扎实的数学基础或理科思维。如果你只是想尽快完成本科毕业论文，这并不成问题。但如果你想深入研究密码学，请在联系我之前做好充分的心理准备。
